# Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal

- Alias: `fladistctapp5`
- CourtListener: [fladistctapp5](https://www.courtlistener.com/?court=fladistctapp5)
- Level: state-appellate
- Circuit: `ca11`
- State / territory: Florida
- Status: **up for review** (29%); manual status in `court.json`: `todo`

## Checklist

- [x] `rules.md` present
- [x] `usage/SOURCE.md` names at least 2 FILED-EXAMPLE PDFs (different filers)
- [ ] `usage/` has at least 2 INPUT .md samples
- [ ] typst engine passes (`usage/.check-typst.txt` valid)
- [ ] latex engine passes (`usage/.check-latex.txt` valid)
- [ ] docx engine passes (`usage/.check-docx.txt` valid)
- [ ] a review file in `reviews/`

Engines (doc folders passing / with that template): typst `8/8`, latex `8/8`, docx `8/8`.

`done` is set by a human in `court.json` (`"status": "done"`); nothing automated writes it.
A court is `up for review` when `rules.md` is present and every doc folder under it with a `usage/INPUT-*.md` has a valid `usage/.check-typst.txt` stamp (`just eval` writes them; the default checks are `data/checks-default.yaml`).

## Doc folders

8 of 8 doc folders with an INPUT pass the typst eval.

| Doc type | Status | Typst | LaTeX | DOCX |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [amicus-brief](amicus-brief) | up for review | pass | pass | pass |
| [answering-brief](answering-brief) | up for review | pass | pass | pass |
| [motion-brief](motion-brief) | up for review | pass | pass | pass |

## Folders

- `typst/` Typst template (primary)
- `latex/` LaTeX template
- `docx/` Word template (`reference.xml`, or a committed `reference.docx`, plus `*.lua` filters; `fb render --engine docx` builds it)
- `usage/` filed examples `FILED-EXAMPLE-<doctype>[-<n>].pdf` from different filers and `SOURCE.md`; sample inputs `INPUT-<doctype>[-<n>].md`; renders `OUTPUT-<doctype>[-<n>].typst.pdf`, `.latex.pdf`, `.docx`, `.docx.pdf` (same id as the INPUT); stamps `.check-<engine>.txt`
