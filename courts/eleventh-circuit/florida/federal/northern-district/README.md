# United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida

- Alias: `flnd`
- CourtListener: [flnd](https://www.courtlistener.com/?court=flnd)
- Level: district
- Circuit: `ca11`
- State / territory: Florida
- Status: **up for review** (14%); manual status in `court.json`: `todo`

## Checklist

- [x] `rules.md` present
- [ ] `usage/SOURCE.md` names at least 2 FILED-EXAMPLE PDFs (different filers)
- [ ] `usage/` has at least 2 INPUT .md samples
- [ ] typst engine passes (`usage/.check-typst.txt` valid)
- [ ] latex engine passes (`usage/.check-latex.txt` valid)
- [ ] docx engine passes (`usage/.check-docx.txt` valid)
- [ ] a review file in `reviews/`

Engines (doc folders passing / with that template): typst `2/2`, latex `—`, docx `2/2`.

`done` is set by a human in `court.json` (`"status": "done"`); nothing automated writes it.
A court is `up for review` when `rules.md` is present and every doc folder under it with a `usage/INPUT-*.md` has a valid `usage/.check-typst.txt` stamp (`just eval` writes them; the default checks are `data/checks-default.yaml`).

## Doc folders

2 of 2 doc folders with an INPUT pass the typst eval.

| Doc type | Status | Typst | LaTeX | DOCX |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [complaint](complaint) | up for review | pass | — | pass |
| [motion-brief](motion-brief) | up for review | pass | — | pass |

## Folders

- `typst/` Typst template (primary)
- `latex/` LaTeX template
- `docx/` Word template (reference.docx + filters)
- `usage/` filed examples `FILED-EXAMPLE-<doctype>[-<n>].pdf` from different filers and `SOURCE.md`; sample inputs `INPUT-<doctype>[-<n>].md`; renders `OUTPUT-<doctype>[-<n>].typst.pdf`, `.latex.pdf`, `.docx`, `.docx.pdf` (same id as the INPUT); stamps `.check-<engine>.txt`

- [ ] `usage/` has at least 2 filed PDFs (different filers)
- [ ] `usage/` has at least 2 .md samples

- [ ] overlay PDF present (`usage/*-overlay.pdf`)

## Typeface

N.D. Fla. Loc. R. 5.1(C) requires "at least 14-point font" and names no face (text read 2026-10-14 from the court's local rules PDF, `https://flnd.uscourts.gov/sites/flnd/files/local_rules/local_rules_0.pdf`). Under `docs/FONTS.md` ("No face named") both doc types keep the vendored **EB Garamond** at 14 pt. The filed exemplars are Times New Roman; that is the filer's choice, not a court requirement, so no Liberation Serif substitute is used. Each doc-type README carries its own typeface row.

- `usage/` real filed examples from different filers (PDF) and `SOURCE.md`
- `usage/` sample inputs (.md); renders `<id>.pdf`, `<id>.latex.pdf`, `<id>.docx`, `<id>.docx.pdf`; stamps `.check-<engine>.txt`
